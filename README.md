# BDA-Project
Project for Big Data Analytics A.A. 2021/22

## The Movies Dataset
*Link: https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=movies_metadata.csv*

These files contain metadata for all 45,000 movies listed in the Full MovieLens Dataset. The dataset consists of movies released on or before July 2017. 
Data points include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, revenue, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, countries, TMDB vote counts and vote averages.
 
### Predictive variables
Each instance in the dataset has several predictor variables (quantitative or categorical), which indicate characteristics of the movie like cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, revenue, posters, release dates, adult, etc.
 
### Predictive task
1. Option 1: To create a model to predict the average vote of the movie i.e., the vote_average variable. 
2. Option 2: To create a model to predict the revenue of the movie, i.e., the revenue variable. 
3. Option 3: To create a model to predict the popularity of the movie, i.e., the popularity variable. 

## Module 1: Big Data Analytics and Social Mining
In this module, analytical methods and processes are presented through exemplary cases studies in challenging domains, organized according to the following topics:
* The Big Data Scenario and the new questions to be answered
* Sports Analytics:
  1. Soccer data landscape and injury prediction
  2. Analysis and evolution of sports performance
* Mobility Analytics
  1. Mobility data landscape and mobility data mining methods
  2. Understanding Human Mobility with vehicular sensors (GPS)
  3. Mobility Analytics: Novel Demography with mobile-phone data
* Social Media Mining
  1. The social media data landscape: Facebook, Linked-in, Twitter, Last_FM
  2. Sentiment analysis. example from human migration studies
  3. Discussion on ethical issues of Big Data Analytics
* Well-being&Now-casting
  1. Nowcasting influenza with retail market data
  2. Predicting well-being from human mobility patterns
* Paper presentations by students

## Module 2: Big Data Analytics Technologies
This module will provide to the students the technologies to collect, manipulate and process big data. In particular, the following tools will be presented:
* Python for Data Science
* The Jupyter Notebook: developing open-source and reproducible data science
* MongoDB: fast querying and aggregation in NoSQL databases
* GeoPandas: analyze geo-spatial data with Python
* Scikit-learn: machine learning in Python
* Keras: deep learning in Python

## Module 3: Laboratory for Interactive Project Development
During the course, teams of students will be guided in the development of a big data analytics project. The projects will be based on real-world datasets covering several thematic areas. Discussions and presentation in class, at different stages of the project execution, will be performed.
* 1st Mid Term: Data Understanding and Project Formulation
* 2nd Mid Term: Model(s) construction and evaluation
* 3rd Mid Term: Model interpretation/explanation
* Exam: Final Project results
